            Inference in Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs</span> with
          Christoph Rothe.<br>

          <p class="ex2"> The confidence intervals (CIs) commonly reported in
            empirical fuzzy regression discontinuity studies are justified by
            theoretical arguments which assume that the running variable is
            continuously distributed with positive density around the cutoff,
            and that the jump in treatment probabilities at the cutoff is
            “large”. In this paper, we provide new confidence sets (CSs) that do
            not rely on such assumptions. Their construction is analogous to
            that of Anderson-Rubin CSs in the literature on instrumental
            variable models. Our CSs are based on local linear regression, and
            are bias-aware, in the sense that they explicitly take the possible
            smoothing bias into account. They are valid under a wide range of
            empirically relevant conditions in which existing CIs generally
            fail. These conditions include discrete running variables, donut
            designs, and weak identification. But our CS also perform favorably
            relative to existing CIs in the canonical setting with a continuous
            running variable, and can thus be used in all fuzzy regression
            discontinuity applications.</p>

            Analysis of LATE Estimates to a Violation of the Monotonicity

        <div id="myDIV2">
          <p class="ex2"> This paper presents a method to assess the sensitivity
            of treatment effect estimates to potential violations of the
            monotonicity assumption. I propose a model in which the degree to
            which monotonicity is violated is measured by two sensitivity
            parameters: One determines the population size of defiers and the
            other treatment effect heterogeneity between compliers and defiers.
            I identify the breakdown frontier, which is the set of sensitivity
            parameters that imply the weakest assumptions, which are necessary
            to draw a particular empirical conclusion, e.g. the average
            treatment effect is positive. Evaluating the plausibility of these
            parameters allows researchers to assess the credibility of this
            conclusion. I show how to conduct inference on these parameter
            estimates, where confidence sets are obtained through a bootstrap
            method. The performance of the breakdown frontier estimator is
            evaluated in a Monte Carlo study and illustrated in an empirical
            example.</p>

            Covariate Adjustments in Regression Discontinuity Designs </span>
          with Tomasz Olma and Christoph Rothe. <br>
          May 2023, under revision [<button class="button" onclick="myFunction3()">Abstract</button>]

        <div id="myDIV3">
          <p class="ex2"> Empirical regression discontinuity (RD) studies often use covariates to increase the
                          precision of their estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel class of estimators that use
                          such covariate information more efficiently than existing methods and can accommodate
                          many covariates. It involves running a standard RD analysis in which a function of the
                          covariates has been subtracted from the original outcome variable. We characterize the
                          function that leads to the estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance, and consider
                          feasible versions of such estimators in which this function is estimated, for example,
                          through modern machine learning techniques. </p>

          with Christoph Rothe. <br>
          August 2023, preliminary [<button class="button" onclick="myFunction3()">Abstract</button>]
          [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14464" target="_blank">arxiv</a>]

        <div id="myDIV3">
          <p class="ex2"> We study the econometric properties of so-called donut 
            regression discontinuity (RD) designs, a robustness exercise which involves 
            repeating estimation and inference without the data points in some area around 
            the treatment threshold. This approach is often motivated by concerns that 
            possible systematic sorting of units, or similar data issues, in some neighborhood 
            of the treatment threshold might distort estimation and inference of RD treatment effects.
            We show that donut RD estimators can have substantially larger bias and variance than 
            contentional RD estimators, and that the corresponding confidence intervals can be substantially longer. 
            We also provide a formal testing framework for comparing donut and conventional RD estimation results.
